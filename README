This package helps a comparison of 3 kinds of k-means methods: Classic k-means, k-means++, and k-means||.

Installization:
1. Download and uncompress or clone this package
2. Change directory to kmeansmethods/
3. Run "python3 setup.py install"

A total of 2 packages would be installed: kmeanspython and kmeanscython. We provide python version and cython for every function to compare their performance. Functions in kmeanscython package have "_cython" suffix in their names.

All the 3 algorithms use Lloydâ€™s iteration as their iteration part. However they have different initialization of centers, which may reduce the number of loops to converge. 
All 3 initialization functions, classic initialization function "kmeansinit", k-means++ initialization function "kmeansinitpp", and k-means|| initialization function "kmeansinitvv", takes 2 input variable: numpy array of data X, and number of centers k. And they return a numpy array of generated initial centers.
The iteration function "kmeansloop" takes 4 input variables: numpy array of data X, initial centers init (generated by the 3 initialization functions), number of maximum iteration maxiter, and tolerance for ending the iteration tol.
